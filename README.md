# Portal Game
Project done for "Computer Graphics" college course, coded in Java Script (WebGL).

Part of the base WebGL code has been given by the professor during lectures, as a starting point that sets up the project. 

All of the remaining code: game logic, physics, level design, shaders, sound effects, etc. was written by Danilo Đurić.
